# Olympics Data Analysis

In Data Science field, there is a big topic before creating a model for future prediction is Data Analysis. We can find out the hidden stories of the data when we visualize it. Also sometimes it helps that which type of algorithm will be great for that data. So I build a website using `StreamKLit` python library to visualize the 120 Years of Olympics history.

------
This project is divided into 4 small steps:
- Medal tally (No. of total medals, No. of Gold Medals, No. of Silver Medals and No. of Bronze Medals) over the years of different countries.
- Overall analysis like how many sports are played, how many countries are participated, how many hosts and so on.
